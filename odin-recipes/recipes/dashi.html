  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Dashi is simple Japanese soup broth, which acts as the base for many popular dishes such 
    as miso soup, ramen and shabu shabu. The dashi in this recipe is called Awase Dashi, and
    uses a combination of dried seaweed and bonito flakes. Awase means 'to combine' in Japanese</p>
